# Testnet instance

An example instance of the Reti UI running on Algorand Testnet can be found at [https://reti.vercel.app](https://reti.vercel.app)

TxnLab will not deploy or host a mainnet instance of Reti, but expect information to be provided on an official mainnet application ID and UI that the community launches.
